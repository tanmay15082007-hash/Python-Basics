# In python,variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. 
# A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=)

age = 34 #integer
name = "Tanmay" #string
cgpa = 4.55 #float

# Rules of defining a variable in python
# Variable namesmust start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore(_)
# They can contain numbers,letters and underscore
# Variable names are case sensitive (age and Age are different)
# avoid using pthon keywords (e.g.,if,for,while) as variable names

#34age = 4#invalid because variable cant start with number
age = 32 #valid because variable can start with letter
#a$$ge = 45# invalid as variable cant contain special characters other than underscore
__age =  34
__nice_45 = 34
