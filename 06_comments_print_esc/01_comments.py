Hence y is a solution of (Fig. 4A). This ODE is of the form With positive-constant k it can
model exponential growth, for instance, of colonies of bacteria or populations of animals. It also applies to
humans for small populations in a large country (e.g., the United States in early times) and is then known as
Malthus’s law.1 We shall say more about this topic in Sec. 1.5.

exponential decay, as, for instance, of a radioactive substance (see Example 5). j

Named after the English pioneer in classic economics, THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS (1766–1834).We see that each ODE in these examples has a solution that contains an arbitrary
constant c. Such a solution containing an arbitrary constant c is called a general solution
of the ODE.
(We shall see that c is sometimes not completely arbitrary but must be restricted to some
interval to avoid complex expressions in the solution.)
We shall develop methods that will give general solutions uniquely (perhaps except for
notation). Hence we shall say the general solution of a given ODE (instead of a general
solution).
Geometrically, the general
